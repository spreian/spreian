I am a pharmacist and Qualified Person (QP) with extensive experience in GMP and GDP environments and a clear specialization in data-driven quality management.

As a GDP & GMP Specialist I have held various Quality Assurance positions throughout my career (including the role of a Qualified Person (QP) and a deputy Responsible Person (RP)), where I have actively contributed to enhancing and sustaining quality systems in GxP regulated environments.

Since I was repeatedly confronted with data analysis in my career, I decided at the end of 2022 to further my education in this area and to acquire the appropriate Data Analyst hard skills (Python, SQL, Power BI, Excel). 

In 2024, I achieved the qualification to act as managing director under trade law for medicinal products and medical devices ('Gewerberechtlicher Geschäftsführer Arzneimittel/Medizinprodukte').

Recently I started my own business as a GDP & GMP Consultant and Freelance Data Analyst. I support clients to ensure Quality and Compliance in GDP and GMP regulated environments.
