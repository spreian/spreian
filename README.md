I am a Pharmacist by training, a Qualified Person by profession and a Data Analyst by passion.

As a GDP & GMP Specialist I have held various Quality Assurance (QA) positions throughout my career (including the role of a Qualified Person (QP) and a deputy Responsible Person (RP)), where I have actively contributed to enhancing and sustaining Quality Systems in GxP regulated environments.

Since I was repeatedly confronted with data analysis in my career, I decided at the end of 2022 to further my education in this area and to acquire the appropriate Data Analyst hard skills (Python, SQL, Power BI, Excel). 

In 2024, I achieved the qualification to act as managing director under trade law for medicinal products and medical devices ('Gewerberechtlicher Geschäftsführer Arzneimittel/Medizinprodukte').

Recently I started my own business as a GDP & GMP Consultant and Freelance Data Analyst. I support companies building scalable, inspection-ready Quality Systems in GxP.
